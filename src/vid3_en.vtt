00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.460
It was morning already

2
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.000
But my mind is full of missing thoughts for you

3
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.660
It was morning already

4
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.740
But I’m still here singing my blues

5
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.739
Please don’t go anywhere

6
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.370
Don’t listen to those sweet words

7
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.230
To forget that I’m always here waiting for you every night

8
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.970
Many sorrows out there

9
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.000
Please don’t hesitate, just come back home

10
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.910
It was morning already

11
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.030
I’m waiting for you

12
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.170
Just be happy, don’t absorb in it too much

13
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.340
The clock still runs tik tok

14
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.200
Why don’t you come home?

15
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.770
Don’t be like that

16
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.060
Don’t break this fragile heart into pieces

17
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.600
Don’t say sorry

18
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.630
Where are you now?

19
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.480
Hey Mr. Taxi, what time is it?

20
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.230
I've just gone out for 30 minutes and have repeatedly sneezed

21
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.630
You post status and update story without a break

22
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.630
You said you missed Ricky OTD

23
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.740
The restaurant doesn’t get a chance to serve the appetizer

24
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.200
when the phone message tells me to go home (really?)

25
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.280
When the party is not over

26
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.540
I’m having fun with homies

27
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.710
On a crowded street, I have a hard and long way home to go though

28
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.740
I’m afraid of red light

29
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.340
I’m waiting at green light

30
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.230
You call you to come home immediately, otherwise my life will be over

31
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.340
I pass lots of crossroads

32
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.570
My friends invited me to go out, I ignored it all

33
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.310
You’re little too much, just depends on your charming beauty

34
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.830
Wait a minute, turn right and I could be at home

35
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.660
I’m waiting for you

36
00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.400
Just be happy, don’t absorb in it too much

37
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.910
The clock still runs tik tok

38
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.680
Why don’t you come home?

39
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.630
Don’t be like that

40
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.510
Don’t break this fragile heart into pieces

41
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.460
Don’t say sorry

42
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.910
Where are you now?

43
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.910
15 minutes.. 5 minutes…, you only have 3 minutes left

44
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.260
Go home, baby. If not, hmm

45
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.660
15 minutes.. 5 minutes…, you only have 3 minutes left

46
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.110
Why do I keep longing for you?

47
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.860
Don’t be like that

48
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.910
Don’t break this fragile heart into pieces

49
00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.680
Don’t say sorry

50
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.680
Where are you now?

51
00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.510
Why don’t you come back?

52
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.710
Why don’t you come back home?
